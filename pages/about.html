    <h3>How it started</h3>
    <p class="boxcontainer">
        It was a rainy afternoon when Mr. Carbonara (Cal) met Ms. Pesto (Tria) first met. They were on a restaurant full of people and there were no seats for everyone. Mr. Carbonara was struggling to find a seat for him to enjoy his freshly served carbonara until he found Ms. Pesto eating alone in a table for two people. He approached Ms. Pesto and asked if he could share a seat with her while eating and Ms. Pesto agreed. The two started talking about the pasta they were eating and one thing led to another, they found themselves laughing in a crowded restaurant on a rainy day. After that meal, they decided to keep in touch with each other and then they became business partners for life.
